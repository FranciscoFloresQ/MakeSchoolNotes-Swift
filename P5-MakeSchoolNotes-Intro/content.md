That time has come to make you first *real* app, your own version of the classic *Notes* app.  After finishing the *SimpleApp* tutorial you should have an understanding
of how to use Xcode and the fundemental building blocks of how an App is put together.  

In this tutorial we will build upon that knowledge to build a fully fledged application that will touch upon many beginner and intermediate development topics. 

We are going to be focusing on the following topics:

- Introduction to Table Views
- What is delegation?
- Creating notes programmatically

- Using multiple ViewControllers & Containers
- Capturing User Input
- Keyboard Handling
- Using Seques

We will touch on other topic through the course of this tutorial however this is an outline of the skills and questions you will be able to answer by the end of this tutorial.

By the end of it you will have a good understanding of building a complete iOS utility app, this will put you in good stead for our next tutorial *Makestagram*!
